{# The one aggregation used everywhere identifier_mapping collapses rows that
   share (active_snowplow_id, id_type, id_value) into a single row: earliest
   first_seen with its app and event id, latest last_seen with its app, and a
   row_number so the caller keeps one row per group. Kept in one place so the
   orderings cannot drift apart between call sites. #}

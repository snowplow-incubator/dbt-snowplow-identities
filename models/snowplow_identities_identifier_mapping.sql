  All identifiers currently linked to an active_snowplow_id -- the documented surface
  for looking up a person by an external identifier.

  Resolution happens here, at read time: snowplow_identities_identifier_mapping_base
  holds immutable rows at their event-time snowplow_id, and this view joins them to the
  current snowplow_id_mapping. Because the join is evaluated on every query, a merge is
  reflected immediately with no rows rewritten, re-pointed, or deleted upstream.

  Columns and grain are unchanged from previous versions, where this was an incremental
  table: one row per (active_snowplow_id, id_type, id_value), with `uuid` the surrogate
  of those three. Consumers need no changes.

  This view resolves one hop. It depends on snowplow_id_mapping holding no chains
  (an active_snowplow_id never itself appearing as a snowplow_id), which its
  true_parents filter guarantees and tests/snowplow_id_mapping_no_chains.sql asserts.
